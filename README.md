# odin-landing-page

Landing page project from Odin Project foundation course.

This project will combine and have me use the knowledge of what I've learned so far in the foundation course. It will have a heavy emphasis on using flexbox to arrange the site. I will be making a fictitious modern interpretation of the military company "West-Tek" presented in fallout, it will be advertising their new T-45 power armor.
